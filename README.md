# ip-msg

A very much WIP peer-to-peer chat app. Written for fun and learning purposes.

## Running

To build and run you can use the following options

### Development

To build and run during development, you can use the ```deno task tauri dev`` command in the root directory to run the app with support for hot reload.

### Production

To build the app in production mode, you can use the ```deno task tauri build``` command. The output will be an .msi and NSIS .exe installer, you can use either one.
